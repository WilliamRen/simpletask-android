Simpletask
==========

:slug: index

Simpletask_ is based on the brilliant `todo.txt <http://todotxt.com>`__
by `Gina Trapani <http://ginatrapani.org/>`__. The goal of the
application is to provide a tool to do GTD without providing an
overwhelming amount of options. Even though Simpletask can be customised
by a fairly large amount of settings, the defaults should be sane and
require no change.

Simpletask_ can be used as a very simple todo list manager or as a more
complex action manager for GTD or `Manage Your Now <{filename}MYN.rst>`__.
